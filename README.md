# Examples
https://www.pokedex.org/  uses local db & info how to populate the db with data

# API
## Get a pokemon by id - very slow
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/150

# API - better/faster
https://pokemontcg.io/

# Path
1. Show students more about using an api. Students will explore the available pokemon data to see what they might want to make use of
1. Each student picks a type of Pokemon info from the API doc info they want to illustrate.
1. Each student, or group of 2, design one page on paper (mockup). Page must include something that can be dynamically rendered. Any repeating data will work, e.g., pokemon pictures.
1. build **static** pages with sample data
1. Introduce some dynamic rendering on one or more of the pages that makes use of some combination of a loop, variables, DOM API and conditional flow.
1. Karl will try to set things up so they can just send URLs to a function and get back data. Not sure how well that will work out but will see how students grasp concepts along the way and decide.
